**This codebase has only been tested for Atari Breakout. It is very hacky, trained on a small number of samples, and is not at all optimized. Use at your own risk!**

# Atari Pixels Project

This projects aims to create a neural playable version of Atari Breakout by learning purely from videos of the game. It's a small replica of what [Google's Genie project](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/), where they learned an interactive and playable world models purely through videos of game.

## Part 1: DQN Training & Exploration
- Implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for Atari Breakout.
- Supports two exploration strategies:
  - **Temperature-based (Boltzmann) exploration** with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER).
  - **Random Network Distillation (RND)** for intrinsic motivation and improved exploration.
- Modular, efficient, and test-driven codebase.
- Current progress: Agent achieves a score up to 20.
- Next steps: Train for longer, increase max steps per episode to 10,000, and target scores of 200+.

See [part1.md](part1.md) for full details, implementation, and next steps.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies and Atari ROMs
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m AutoROM --accept-license
```

### 2. Train the DQN Agent
- **Default (temperature-based exploration):**
  ```bash
  python train_dqn.py
  ```
- **RND-based exploration:**
  ```bash
  python train_dqn.py --exploration_mode rnd
  ```
- Additional arguments (see `python train_dqn.py --help`) allow you to control episodes, buffer size, and more.

### 3. Generate Gameplay Videos
- To record videos of a trained (or random) agent:
  ```bash
  python record_videos.py --checkpoint_path <path_to_checkpoint> --output_dir videos/
  e.g. python record_videos.py --bulk --total_videos 100 --percent_random 15 --output_dir bulk_videos
  ```
- Replace `<path_to_checkpoint>` with the path to your saved model checkpoint (see `checkpoints/`).
- Videos will be saved as MP4 files in the specified output directory.

---

## Part 2: Train Latent Action Prediction Model
- **Prepare data:** Ensure gameplay videos are available in `bulk_videos/` (from Part 1).
- **Train VQ-VAE latent action model:**
  ```bash
  python train_latent_action.py
  ```
- **Checkpoints and logs:**
  - Best model: `checkpoints/latent_action/best.pt`
  - Processed data: see `data/` and `vqvae_recons/`
  - Training logs and metrics: Weights & Biases (wandb)
- **Evaluation:**
  - Run `test_latent_action_model.py` for automated tests and metrics
  - Visualize reconstructions and codebook usage as described in part2.md

See [part2.md](part2.md) for full details, implementation, and next steps.

---

## Part 3: Next Frame Prediction Model (World Model)
- **Note:** The decoder from Part 2 serves as the world model. No separate training is required unless you wish to experiment with alternative architectures.
- **Evaluate world model:**
  - Use the decoder to predict next frames given current frame and latent action index
  - For multi-step prediction and rollout analysis, see evaluation code in `test_latent_action_model.py`

---

## Part 4: Train Action-to-Latent Mapping Model
- **Extract (action, latent_code) pairs using trained VQ-VAE:**
  ```bash
  python collect_action_latent_pairs.py
  ```
  - Output: `data/actions/action_latent_pairs.json`
- **Train the action-to-latent MLP:**
  ```bash
  python train_action_to_latent.py
  ```
  - Best checkpoint: `checkpoints/latent_action/action_to_latent_best.pt`
- **Evaluate mapping accuracy:**
  - Run `test_latent_action_data_collection.py` and `test_latent_action_model.py`
  - Analyze accuracy and code distributions as described in part4.md

See [part4.md](part4.md) for full details, implementation, and next steps.

## Part 5: Playable Neural Breakout (World Model Demo)
- **Run a random agent in the neural world model:**
  ```bash
  python neural_random_game.py
  ```
  - Output: `data/neural_random_game.gif` (video of neural gameplay)
- **Play Breakout using the neural world model:**
  ```bash
  python play_neural_breakout.py
  ```
  - Controls: SPACE (Fire), LEFT/RIGHT ARROW, PERIOD (NOOP), ESC/Q (Quit)
  - Requires trained models from Parts 2 and 4
- **All inference runs on GPU if available, otherwise MPS/CPU.**
- **For best performance, ensure torch.compile is enabled and models are on CUDA.**

See [part5.md](part5.md) for full details, implementation, and next steps.

## Utility & Debug Scripts
- **debug_color_channels.py:** Visualizes and compares color channels between environment frames and PNG files to debug color mismatches.
- **debug_first_step_difference.py:** Compares predicted vs. ground truth latents and reconstructions for the first step of the neural random game, helping debug model discrepancies.
- **neural_random_game.py:** Runs a random agent in the neural world model and saves a GIF of the generated gameplay for qualitative evaluation.

---
## Suggested Improvements
- Train DQN agent for longer (by increasing max steps per episode to 10,000 and target scores of 200+)
- Generate 1000s of videos of agent playing with a higher percentage of random agent actions:
  ```bash
  python record_videos.py --bulk --total_videos 1000 --percent_random 20 --output_dir bulk_videos
  ```
- Train the latent action model for much longer to achieve convergence
- Collect much more data for action → latent code mapping
- Try with different Atari games
